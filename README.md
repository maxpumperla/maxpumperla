## Hi there, I'm @maxpumperla 👋

I’m a Data Scientist and Engineer from Hamburg, Germany. I’m an open source contributor, author of [machine learning & technology books](https://www.amazon.com/Max-Pumperla/e/B0785XFDL7/ref=dp_byline_cont_pop_book_1), speaker at international conferences and [Coursera instructor](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai/home/welcome).

I specialize in Deep Learning and its applications and can build machine learning solutions and data products from first prototype to production. As [DL4J core developer](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j), [Keras contributor](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/graphs/contributors), Hyperopt maintainer and author of a range of open source libraries, I have a distinct view on machine learning engineering and the data science ecosystem.

### Here's what I'm up to right now

- 📖 I’m currently working on a new book with O'Reilly called "Learning Ray", which helps you get started with [Ray](https://www.ray.io/). I'm writing standalone Jupyter notebooks alongside the book, which you can find in [this repo](https://github.com/maxpumperla/learning_ray).
- 🔭 Some of the materials from my courses as Data Science professor at IU can be [found here](https://github.com/iubh). My teaching centers around programming Python, big data technologies and reinforcement learning at the moment.
- 🔭 If you have interesting freelance opportunities, don't hesitate to get in touch with me.
- 💬 Ask me about anything Python or Data Science related. I'm happy to discuss!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I get asked for directions by total strangers all the time, even in foreign countries, and I have yet to figure out why.

### Interesting things I've been doing in the past

- 📖 If you like the game of Go, or Python, or both, you might enjoy my book ["Deep Learning and the Game of Go" (Manning)](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Game-Max-Pumperla/dp/1617295329/). All the code for the book is [free here on GitHub](https://github.com/maxpumperla/deep_learning_and_the_game_of_go).  
- 🐍 I've authored [Elephas: Distributed Deep Learning with Keras & Spark](https://github.com/maxpumperla/elephas)
- 🐍 I'm also the author of [Hyperas: simple hyperparameter optimization for Keras models.](https://github.com/maxpumperla/hyperas)
- 🐍 We recently co-authored [Logodetect: One-shot logo detection](https://github.com/Heldenkombinat/Logodetect).
- 🐍 [Hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) is not the most active project anymore, but I'm still trying my best to set aside some time here and there to maintain it.
- 🐍 In what feels like the very distant past, I've been a fairly active [Keras contributor](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) once.
