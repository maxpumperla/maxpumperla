## Hi there, I'm Max 👋

I’m an entrepreneur, engineer and educator from Hamburg, Germany. What I enjoy most is building & shipping interesting projects and writing about them. With more than 15 years of professional experience, I can help you realize your projects, too.

As an engineer, I specialize in Deep Learning and its applications and can build machine learning solutions and data products from first prototype to production. As [Ray contributor](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/), [DL4J core developer](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j), [Keras contributor](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/graphs/contributors), [Hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) maintainer and author of a range of open source libraries, I have a distinct view on ML engineering and the data science ecosystem.

### Here's what I'm up to right now

- 🔭 My primary focus is on [building companies](http://unbounded.limited) I want to own and run, with people I value, solving problems I care about.
- 🔭 We currently build the next generation of language learning apps at [lingonook](https://lingonook.com).
- 🔭 At [ganzda](https://ganzda.de) we aim to bring meditation practice to the German market.
- 🔭 At [gradefast](https://gradefa.st) and [schnellkorrigiert](https://schnellkorrigiert.de) we help teachers save valuable time spent on corrections.
- 🔭 Reach out to me if you seek a technical partner or need advise building your own startups.

### Projects you might like

- 📖 Check out my [O'Reilly book called "Learning Ray"](https://maxpumperla.com/learning_ray/), which helps you get started with distributed Python with Ray. Most content is available on my homepage.
- 📖 If you like the game of Go, or Python, or both, you might enjoy my book ["Deep Learning and the Game of Go" (Manning)](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Game-Max-Pumperla/dp/1617295329/). All the code for the book is [free here on GitHub](https://github.com/maxpumperla/deep_learning_and_the_game_of_go).  
- 🐍 I've authored [Elephas: Distributed Deep Learning with Keras & Spark](https://github.com/maxpumperla/elephas)
- 🐍 I'm also the author of [Hyperas: simple hyperparameter optimization for Keras models.](https://github.com/maxpumperla/hyperas)
- 🐍 We co-authored [Logodetect: One-shot logo detection](https://github.com/Heldenkombinat/Logodetect).
- 🐍 [Hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt) is not the most active project anymore, but I'm still trying my best to set aside some time here and there to maintain it.
- 🐍 In what feels like the very distant past, I've been a fairly active [Keras contributor](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) once.
- 💬 Ask me about anything Python or Data Science related. I'm happy to discuss!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I get asked for directions by total strangers all the time, even in foreign countries (and I have yet to figure out why).
